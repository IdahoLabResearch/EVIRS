  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes, a standard tow truck could be safely employed, as in Figure 1, however, 
        if the damage is more severe, a specialized transport vehicle with a specialized shipping container might be needed, as shown in Figure 2. 
        The transport vehicle should be designed to withstand a thermal runaway event during transport.</li><br>
    <li>The safety of first responders and recovery personnel should be considered. 
        For example, do not attempt loading the transport vehicle or performing an on-site discharge of a stranded EV (electric vehicle) on a busy interstate or during winter weather. 
        Recovery personnel need training on handling and transporting EVs without causing further damage. 
        EV lifting and towing points, known to be safe for first responders, should be used.</li><br>
    <li>Routes for recovery vehicles need to be evaluated. Consider avoiding areas with an abundance of ignitable foliage.
        Bridges, tunnels, and dams need to be avoided if possible. 
        A guide or pilot car is recommended so other motorists are aware of the hazard or to clear the way.</li>
  </ul>
